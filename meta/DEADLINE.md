## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

The two APIS I am using are a Stranger Things quote generator and a
Stranger Things character info generator. To start off the user can click
the generate button as many times as they want (this is utilizing the quote
API) to generate random quotes and once they find one they like they click the
corresponding button which will bring them to a screen first consisting of the quote
and the name of the character who said it from the first API. The second API (the info
one) uses the character name to get various facts about the character along
with a photo of them and these are also displayed. After this the user can click the
back button and repeat the process as many times as they want. Some characters are very
obscure so they have no/not enough info in the second API database and when this happens
the user will encounter an error message upon which they can continue browsing quotes as
they please.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

This is my first time designing an application on my own so it was fun coming up with ideas
on which things I should implement.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I wish I was able to do a more complicated project. I had coded two ideas previous to this one
but I had to restart both times. The first time the APIS didn't fully work properly due to a paywall
and with the second time both APIS turned out to be Rapid. Due to a time crunch with other finals
and projects I had to simplify my ideas given the APIS I could find. If I had more time I would
have liked to continue searching for other APIS and code that help could make my ideas come to life.
