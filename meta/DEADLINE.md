## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

APIS:
https://www.omdbapi.com/#usage
https://api-ninjas.com/api/celebrity
To start off, the user types in a movie or television series into the searchbar at the top
and then clicks the search button next to it. This will request the movie/series info from
the first API and display the title, rating, release date, plot, actors, and the poster. The
second API will then use the first actor(the lead actor) in the actors list from the first API
to request that actors information. The Actors name, net worth, birthday, and age will be
displayed. Depending on the popularity of the movie/series or and/or actor some information
may not be available so the app displays "N/A". If the user inputs an invalid name then an error
will pop up directing the user to input a valid name.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

This is my first time designing an application on my own so it was fun coming up with ideas
on which things I should implement.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I wish I was able to do a more complicated project. I had coded three projects previous to this one
but I had to restart all three times. The first time the APIS didn't fully work properly due to a paywall,
the second time both APIS turned out to be Rapid, and the third time my use of user input was not adequate.
Due to a time crunch with other finals and projects I had to simplify my ideas given the APIS I could find.
If I had more time I would have liked to continue searching for other APIS and code that help could make my
ideas come to life.
